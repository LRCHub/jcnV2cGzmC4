[00:00.73] Fuck you, and you, and you
[00:05.06] I hate your friends and they hate me, too
[00:08.67] I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
[00:12.09] This that hot girl bummer anthem
[00:13.92] Turn it up and throw a tantrum
[00:28.92] 
[00:15.98] This that hot girl bummer anthem
[00:17.68] Turn it up and throw a tantrum
[00:19.66] This that throw up in your Birkin bag
[00:21.63] Up with someone random
[00:23.23] This that social awkward suicide
[00:25.24] That buy your lips and buy your likes
[00:27.47] I swear she had a man
[00:28.65] But shit hit different when it's Thursday night
[00:52.15] 
[00:30.89] That college dropout music
[00:32.58] Every day leg day, she be too thick
[00:34.33] And my friends are all annoying
[00:36.17] But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
[00:38.10] This that 10K on the table just so we can be secluded
[00:41.77] And the vodka came diluted
[00:43.68] One more line, I'm superhuman
[00:58.18] 
[00:45.31] Fuck you, and you, and you
[00:49.37] I hate your friends and they hate me, too

[01:28.07] 
[01:15.07] This that hot girl bummer two-step
[01:16.88] They can't box me in, I'm too left
[01:18.43] This that drip, it's more like oceans
[01:20.34] They can't fit me in a Trojan
[01:22.28] Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag, yeah, that's the slogan
[01:26.16] This that, "Who's all there?"
[01:27.22] I'm pullin' up with a emo chick that's broken
[01:49.72] 
[01:29.57] This that college dropout music
[01:31.42] Every day leg day, she be too thick
[01:33.46] And my friends are all annoying
